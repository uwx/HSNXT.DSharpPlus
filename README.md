# uwx's personalized DSharpPlus build <sub>***not for production use***</sub>

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/nh5afefutje8dlf4/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/uwx/dsharpplus/branch/master)

My custom build of DSharpPlus. This used to be a personalized build with extra features, but those have been moved to
[HSNXT.DSharpPlus](https://github.com/uwx/HSNXT.DSharpPlus), to simplify interoperability with official DSharpPlus.

You can get it on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/uwx/DSharpPlus/releases), but I would recommend against it, since it's the nearly
the exact same as the official build.
