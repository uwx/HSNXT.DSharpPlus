{"Name":"TimeElapsed","Description":"Inspiration for this extension method was another DateTime extension that determines difference in current time and a DateTime object.

That is what I did with this extension method.","Author":"jlafay","SubmittedOn":"9/3/2010 5:44:00 PM","Entries":["public static TimeSpan TimeElapsed(this DateTime date)\r\n{\r\n    return DateTime.Now - date;\r\n}","var myDate = DateTime.Now;\r\nThread.Sleep(3000);\r\nConsole.WriteLine( myDate.TimeElapsed() );\r\n// result -> 00:00:03"]}
