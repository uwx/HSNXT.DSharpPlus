{"Name":"Limit<>","Description":"Limits a value to a maximum. For example this is usefull if you want to feed a progressBar with values from a source which eventually might exceed an expected maximum. This is a generic extension method with IComparable<T> constraint. So every type which implements the IComparable interface benefits from this extension.","Author":"Rainer Hilmer","SubmittedOn":"5/11/2008 6:37:14 PM","Entries":["public static T Limit<T>(this T value, T maximum) where T : IComparable<T>\r\n      {\r\n         return value.CompareTo(maximum) < 1 ? value : maximum;\r\n      }","int testValue = 150;\r\nint limitedResult = testValue.Limit(100);\r\n// limitedResult will be 100 because it's the given maximum."]}
