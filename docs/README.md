### Welcome to the DSharpPlus documentation

DSharpPlus is a Discord API Wrapper based off DiscordSharp by Luigifan,
though it has been rewritten to fit the API standards.

Here you should be able to get enough information to write your own Discord bot. If not, feel free to ask us any questions either in Naamloos' Chat or the Discord API chat.
