# DSharpPlus documentation

DSharpPlus is an unofficial .NET wrapper for the [Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro "Discord API"). It was originally a fork of [DiscordSharp by Suicvne](https://github.com/suicvne/DiscordSharp), but has since been rewritten to fit quality and API standards, as well as target wider range of .NET implementations.
