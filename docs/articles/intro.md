# Getting started with DSharpPlus

Listed here is a couple of links that will help you start developing your own bots.

## New to programming in C#?

Take a look at [this tutorial series by Bob Tabor from MSDN Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C-Fundamentals-for-Absolute-Beginners "C# fundamentals for absolute beginners"). They are excellent videos that go through all the basics, from setting up your development environment, to some of the more advanced concepts. If you're lost, you should definitely give it a watch.
