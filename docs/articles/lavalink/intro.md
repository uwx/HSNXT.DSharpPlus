# Lavalink - the newer, better way to do music
Lavalink is a standalone program, written in Java, using JDA. It's a 
lightweight solution for playing music from sources such as YouTube or 
Soundcloud. Unlike raw voice solutions, such as VoiceNext, Lavalink can handle 
hundreds of concurrent streams, and supports sharding.
